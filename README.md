## Design Document

## Summary  
* I am designing a website for people to communicate with those whom they miss a lot but no longer have a chance to talk to physically. I often imagine that there might be a certain kind of secret space, such as a parallel universe that can connect the people on earth and the deceased ones in the afterlife world. Users can write down that they want to say to their deceased loved ones. I hope to create a space that helps people deliver their messages to their deceased ones and make them feel therapeutic.

* This website is in memory of my beloved grandparents.

## Inspiration

As a novice designer as well as a novice teacher, I enjoy the process of learning new things but I tend to feel nervous easily at the same time. Thus, I have always been interested in things that can calm people’s minds and heal their hearts. Inspired by religious rituals in Taiwan and a 3D computer-animated fantasy film Coco, I want to explore the world of the afterlife, and the way to communicate with our loved ones who had passed away. My beloved grandparents who raised me in my childhood left me 5 years ago and 1 year ago respectively. I often think of them and cannot help but burst into tears while I am alone. I have been wondering if Heaven does exist, what are they doing right now? Can they hear the messages I am trying to deliver to them? 

Multiple research has shown that writing can heal and can serve as a therapy. Whenever I think of them, I write, and I found that writing down what I want to say to them helps me deal with sadness.

In sum, I would like my audience to interact with my website by writing letters to someone they miss a lot but might no longer have a chance to meet them physically. Or they can simply say something to this scret space to express themselves without revealing themselves. I want them to feel therapeutic after saying and sending out what's in their mind.

* I teach myself by googling, watching Youtube tutorials, and asking some experienced classmates.  


## Design Tools
Adobe Illustrator；Atom & Sublime 

* I have researched into a few similar projects, such as [futureme](https://www.futureme.org/) and [the typing effect on the landing page of this website](http://dataf.org/en/). I think in the next few weeks, I would like to use the class time to find out how to create a beautiful letter writing table on the webpage and integrate JS interactive elements to make it automatically form a customized poster. Visually, I would like my piece to look like a beautiful imagery afterlife world with a mailbox that can link me and deceased ones in the two parallel universe.

## Future Development
For the next step, I hope the message wall can become a real space that can collect and display all users' messages to their loved deceased ones. If they are courious about what others have written, they can always go back to the message wall and take a look at these messages. In this way, I believe that users might feel therapeutic and will know that they are not alone. (* All the displayed messages will be anonymous.)

## Self Reflection
As a novice designer, honsestly speaking, working on my final project independently is a bit challenging for me. However, I do enjoy the whole process. Especially when i see my idea has been realized and became a real interactive web page, I feel fulfilled, rewarding, and excited. I am planning to make it one step further next semester to make it a platform that can really make users leave some message here and go back at any time to see these beautiful messages they left for their loved ones. At the same time, I think I should spend more time to shapren my coding skills if I want to create a more intruging website by myself.
